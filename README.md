# RSA Encryption and Decryption in Swift

This project demonstrates how to perform RSA encryption and decryption using Swift and the Security framework. The app includes a simple user interface where users can enter a message, which is then encrypted and decrypted using RSA keys.

#Features
- Generate RSA key pairs (private and public keys)
- Encrypt data using RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
- Decrypt data using RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

- Xcode 12.0 or later
- iOS 13.0 or later
